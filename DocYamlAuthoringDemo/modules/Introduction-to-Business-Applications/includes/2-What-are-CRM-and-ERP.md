## What is CRM?

Customer Relationship Management (CRM) refers to the practices, strategies, and technologies that companies use to track customer interactions and data throughout the customer lifecycle. An effective CRM system allows an organization to analyze customer data and share it across the front-office functions of marketing, sales, and customer service. Analyzing and sharing data improves customer service relationships, increases customer retention, and drives sales growth. Ultimately, CRM is about managing relationships.

## What is ERP?

Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) refers to the systems organizations use to manage core business functions. Generally, it consists of a set of integrated business functions that automate many back-office processes, such as procurement, inventory management, or assembly. By leveraging one central database, organizations can gain a real-time view across their operations. An effective ERP system allows an organization to analyze production data, resulting in more streamlined processes and greater efficiency.
