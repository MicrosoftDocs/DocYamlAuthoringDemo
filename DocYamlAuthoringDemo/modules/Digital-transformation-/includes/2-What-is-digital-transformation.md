**Digital transformation** is about reimagining how you bring together people, data and processes to create value for your customers and maintain a competitive advantage in a digital-first world.

Digital technologies create new opportunities for businesses across the globe by changing the ways that goods and services are produced, sold, and consumed. These technologies help organizations  adapt in the face of competitive pressures and evolving customer needs. Doing so often involves a cultural and technological transformation that focuses on customer engagement, business processes, and data and intelligence.

Microsoft approaches impactful digital transformation across four pillars:
