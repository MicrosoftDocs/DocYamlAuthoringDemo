    title: Check your knowledge
    questions:
    - content: "What is Azure?"
      choices:
      - content: "Microsoft's cloud computing platform, which provides compute power, storage, and services over the Internet using a pay-as-you-go pricing model."
        isCorrect: true
        explanation: "Azure provides raw compute power and storage, as well as services to help you explore new software paradigms such as intelligent bots and mixed reality."
      - content: "A single data center located in Redmond, Washington."
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Azure is made up of data centers distributed throughout the world."
      - content: "A hosting environment specifically for virtual machines"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "While Azure provides raw compute power, such as virtual machines, it also provides many services to help you explore new software paradigms such as intelligent bots and mixed reality."
    - content: "When should you _scale out_ your deployment?"
      choices:
      - content: "When your application or service requires a more powerful CPU or more memory to run faster."
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "In this case, you might _scale up_ by moving your application or service to more powerful hardware."
      - content: "When you need additional virtual machines to speed up your application."
        isCorrect: true
        explanation: "Scaling out means adding additional systems, such as virtual machines. For example, you might create many virtual machines configured in the same way and use a load balancer to distribute work across them."
      - content: "When you're using excess capacity that you don't need."
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "In this case, you might _scale in_ by tearing down systems you don't currently need."
