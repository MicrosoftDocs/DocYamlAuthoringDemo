Congratulations on building your first app! Let's do a quick review of what you've learned so far:

- You built an app based on data in a Microsoft Excel workbook that's stored in Microsoft OneDrive for Business. You learned that Microsoft PowerApps can connect almost as easily to data sources you're already using in the cloud (such as Microsoft SharePoint, Microsoft Azure, Google Drive, and Salesforce) or on-premises.
- You customized the app to make it your own by modifying the look and feel and adding Excel-like functions.
- You learned that you can share apps instantly with your co-workers across the web, tablets, and mobile devices.
- You set up environments so that you can separate a working environment from the one you want to share with your team.

You probably did all this before lunch. Outstanding!

The easiest way to advance your skills is to run the samples, play around with the templates, and generate more apps from your own data.
