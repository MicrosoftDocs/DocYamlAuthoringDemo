## Clean up

The sandbox will clean up your resources automatically for you when you are finished with this module. 

However, when you're working in your own subscription it is best practice at the end of a project to identify whether or not you still need the resources you created. Resources left running can cost you money. You can  delete resources one by one, or just delete the resource group to get rid of the entire set.
